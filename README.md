# Codex CLI (Deprecated standalone)

This repository has been superseded by the in-repo CLI located at:

- `vessel_narrative_system_final/tools/codex-cli/` in the main project repo
- Usage from project root:
  - `node vessel_narrative_system_final/tools/codex-cli/bin/codex.js --help`
  - Or `(cd vessel_narrative_system_final/tools/codex-cli && npm link)` then `codex ...`

The standalone package remains for historical reference only. Please file issues and contributions in the main project.
